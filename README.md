# <Prework Study Guide>

## Description

This is a Prework study guide for Coding Bootcamp. It Consists of notes for studying HTML, CSS, GIT, and JavaScript.

My motivation to create this guide was so I could have a place to store my notes for class, and learn while doing so.
I built this project so I would be able to have and share a resource for effeciently storing my notes, as well as a functional tool for understanding coding within the webpage. It helps a user to quickly find information about the afforementioned topics, as well as having a feature for randomly selecting one of the topics to study within the console. I learned many things in the proccess of creating this guide, like structering a webpage, styling using CSS, and applying logic using JavaScript ammong other things.
